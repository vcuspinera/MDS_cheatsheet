    "|data |Required |A dataset is required for a ggplot, preferably already cleaned, wrangled, and ready to go. |\n",
    "|variable mapping (aka aesthetic) |Required |Aesthetic mappings describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties (aesthetics) of geoms |\n",
    "|marker object (aka geom) |Required |The geometric shapes that will represent your data (squares, circles, diamonds, bars, lines, etc...) |\n",
    "|scale |Optional |Scales control how data values are translated to visual properties like axes labels and limits, legends and keys. See labs() and lims() |\n",

    "|Proportional Ink |The amount of ink used to indicate a value should be proportional to the value itself. |Truncating the y-axis on a bar chart to exaggerate the difference between bars violates the principle of proportional ink |\n",
    "|Data: ink ratio |Remove distracting visual elements to focus attention on the data |Lighten line weights, remove backgrounds, never use 3D or special effects, remove unnecessary/redundant labels, etc |\n",
    "|Labels & legends |Use axes labels and titles to highlight/ communicate data |Never leave your data column names as axes labels! Generally good to add a title |\n",
    "|Overplotting |With large datasets, points overlap, resulting in large clouds of data. |To fix overplotting, could plot just a sample subset of the data, use transparency/alpha, and use smaller points |\n",
